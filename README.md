**SQL queries in MySQL to solve business problems**

### **1st Case Study**

* A company wants to assess its gender equality employment policy by looking into the number of male and female employees in the company. Please find:

   1- The number of male and female employees in the company.

   2- The ratio of males to females hired in the last 5 years

   3- If the ratio is not 1:1, list the departments that have the highest gaps in descending order

   4- If the ratio is not 1:1, then design a 5-year plan to resolve this difference when hiring new employees to fill new positions. Clearly state the number of employees we need to hire each year

   5- If the average salary for males and females is not equal, then find the gap in each department and design a 5-year plan to resolve this situation. Clearly state the number of additional funds that the company needs to allocate

### **2nd Case Study**

* Due to unforeseen events similar to COVID-19 the company wants to downsize its employees to save 20% of the total salaries it pays annually.

  1- Find out the total amount of salaries paid to each department and assess whether any service/contract is overpaid by comparing it to the salaries paid to the employees in the same department (also make sure to consider years of experience/work with the company)

  2- Try to develop a strategy to reduce the cost of all contracts expiring within a year instead of downsizing departments

  3- If reducing salaries for the new contracts does not work, then find a strategy for downsizing the departments. This might include pushing employees to early retirement. Make sure not to reduce any department by more than 50% of its staff

  4- State the names and the employeeâ€™s information whom you plan to either reduce their wages or let them go

  5- If the average salary for males and females is not equal, then you can reduce the salaries of the gender paid higher and state how much funds were saved with this plan/practice

### **3rd Case Study**
* The company wants to offer bonuses at the end of the year to reward its employees. The total bonus paid to all the employees should not exceed $50 million. Design a plan for distributing bonuses based on:

  1- If the average salary for males and females is not equal, then offer a higher bonus to compensate for this circumstance

  2- Years of service with the company.

  3- If their contracts are expiring soon (February 1, 2001) convince them to stay
